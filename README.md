u8glib fork with fixed PCD8544 contrast
=======================================

The original Mercurial repo is at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/u8glib/). This fork merely fixes the issue with PCD8544 contrast setting. Has been tested with Olimex's [MOD-LCD3310](http://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/LCD/MOD-LCD3310/) and a generic LCD3310 scavenged off real Nokia.
